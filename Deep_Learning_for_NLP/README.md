# <b> Predicting Song Similarity Using Deep Neural Networks</b>

## Summary:
<ol>
    <li>
        The source code is split into two parts:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Data Processor.ipynb: This file contains the source code to download the entire data corpus from online databases, filter relevant data, extract the final dataset and generate custom word embeddings to be used for training.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lyrics_Model.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook includes the different models implemented in the project.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        The dataset file, the custom embeddings and the lyrics corpus are essential to train the models. Additionally, multiply other files are also part of the initial data generation and processing phase. Due to the huge nature of the files, it is not included in the repository.
